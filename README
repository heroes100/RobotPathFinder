The script takes in a file input of waypoint(s) within a 100x100 grid that each have a (x,y) locations, and a 'penalty' 
associated for skipping it. The script will recursivley find the fastest path between (0,0) to (100,100) with any appropriate waypoints
and print out the minimum total time required for the robot to traverse.
